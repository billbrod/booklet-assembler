# booklet-assembler

Tools to turn RPG PDFs into booklets for printing, i.e. imposition, inspired by
[this article](https://www.creativegamelife.com/printing-and-binding-rpg-zines).
The article does a lot manually and uses Adobe, so I figured I could do better.

Basically, the goal is to get the PDF into a bunch of single pages, which we
then rearrange into the proper order, and print as a booklet. LibreOffice
(option 1) can rearrange the pages for printing in "brochure" order for us, but
may change the way the pdf looks. Alternatively, we can rearrange the order of
the pages manually, and then print with some other program (I've had good luck
with Firefox).

1. If the PDF only comes as "spreads" (with two content pages side-by-side on a
   single pdf page), we need to split them in half: `spreads_to_singles.sh
   NAME_OF_FILE.pdf`. This will create a new file, `singles.pdf`, wherever you
   ran the script from.
   - Note this assumes that the page before splitting is letter size (8.5in x 11
     in) in landscape rotation. If that assumption is false, will need to change
     the `-g` option passed to `gs`. If you have this issue, open an issue and
     we can try and come up with a more general solution.
2. (Unnecessary if using LibreOffice to print) The single pages need to be
   reorganized so that they can be assembled in the proper order: `n 1 2 n-1 n-2
   3 4 n-3 n-4 5 6 n-5 n-6 ...`: `rearrange_singles.py NAME_OF_SINGLES.pdf`.
   This will create a new file, `booklet.pdf`, for printing with something
   *other* than LibreOffice.
3. Option 1: The singles in regular order will print correctly with LibreOffice
   using the "brochure", as discussed below (LibreOffice may change images /
   symbols on the document, depending on how they're encoded, so you may want to
   use the next option below). We follow [this
   article](https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/printing-booklet-duplex.html.en)
   (skiping the steps about printing in the specific order, steps 3 and 4).
   Pasting the steps below for posterity. First, open the pdf in LibreOffice,
   then:
   
>    Open the print dialog. This can normally be done through Print in the menu or using the Ctrl+P keyboard shortcut.
>
>    Click the Propertiesâ€¦ button
>
>    In the Orientation drop-down list, make sure that Landscape is selected.
>
>    In the Duplex drop-down list, select Short Edge.

   - For my printer and LibreOffice, this is `Duplex: On (Landscape)`

>    Click OK to go back to the print dialog.
>
>    ~~Under Range and Copies, choose Pages.~~
>
>    ~~Type the numbers of the pages in this order (n is the total number of pages, and a multiple of 4):~~
>
>    ~~n, 1, 2, n-1, n-2, 3, 4, n-3, n-4, 5, 6, n-5, n-6, 7, 8, n-7, n-8, 9, 10, n-9, n-10, 11, 12, n-11...~~
>
>    ~~Examples:~~
>
>        ~~4 page booklet: Type 4,1,2,3~~
>
>        ~~8 page booklet: Type 8,1,2,7,6,3,4,5~~
>
>        ~~20 page booklet: Type 20,1,2,19,18,3,4,17,16,5,6,15,14,7,8,13,12,9,10,11~~
>
>    Choose the Page Layout tab.
>
>    Under Layout, select Brochure.
>
>    Under Page Sides, in the Include drop-down list, select All pages.
>
>    Click Print.

4. Option 2: print the booklet pdf using some other pdf printing software,
   making sure to use "Short Edge" for double-sided printing and printing two
   pdf pages per printer page.

# Requirements

- ghostscript for `spreads_to_singles.sh`. This was already installed on my
  system, see [docs](https://ghostscript.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Install.html)
  for how to install your own.
- `pdftk` for `spreads_to_singles.sh`, `rearrange_singles.py`. Also already
  installed for me, probably install from package manager.
- Python 3 for `rearrange_singles.py` because I find arithmatic and constructing
  arrays difficult in bash.
- ImageMagick for `rearrange_singles.py` to create blank files. You may get an
  error about permissions if it's used, in which case see
  [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1081895/trouble-with-batch-conversion-of-png-to-pdf-using-convert)
- LibreOffice (optional) for printing the booklet.
